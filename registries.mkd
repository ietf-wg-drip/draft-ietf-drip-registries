This document describes the discovery and management of DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) in DNS. Authoritative Name Servers, with DRIP specific DNS structures and standard DNS methods, are the Public Information Registries for DETs and their related metadata.

# Introduction

Registries are fundamental to Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Remote Identification (RID). Only very limited operational information can be sent via Broadcast RID, but extended information is sometimes needed. The most essential element of information is the UAS ID, the unique key for lookup of extended information in relevant registries (see Figure 4 of {{RFC9434}}).

Such extended information is retrieved from the UAS ID via the use of a DRIP Entity Tag (DET) {{RFC9374}} which is managed by the DRIP Identity Management Entity (DIME). In this document we assume the DIME is a function of UAS Service Suppliers (USS) (Appendix A.2 of {{RFC9434}}) but a DIME can be independent or handled by another entity as well.

## General Concept

DETs MUST be registered within the hierarchy to perform lookups and also obtain the trust inherited from being a member of the hierarchy. DIME's are the points in the hierarchy that enforce requirements on registration and information access. Other identifiers and their methods are out of scope for this document.

Authoritative Name Servers of the Domain Name System (DNS) provide the Public Information such as the public keys of DETs and pointers to Private Information resources.

Aspects of Private Information Registries to store and protect, through AAA mechanisms, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are not described in this document.

## Use of Existing DNS Models

As DRIP relies on the DNS and as such roughly follows the registrant-registrar-registry model. In DRIP, the registrant would be the end user who owns/controls the Unmanned Aircraft. They are ultimately responsible for the DET and any other information that gets published in the DNS. Registrants use agents known as registrars to manage their interactions with the registry. Registrars typically provide optional additional services such as DNS hosting and so on.

The registry maintains a database of the registered domain names and their related metadata such as the contact details for domain name holder and the relevant registrar. The registry provides DNS service for the zone apex - `3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa` for DRIP (the prefix assigned in {{RFC9374}}) - which contains delegation information for the domain names of the registered DETs. Registries generally provide services such as WHOIS or RDAP to publish metadata about the registered domain names and their registrants and registrars.

Registrants have contracts with registrars who in turn have contracts with registries. Payments follow this model too: the registrant buys services from a registrar who pays for services provided by the registry.

By definition, there can only be one registry for a domain name. Since that registry is a de facto monopoly, the scope of its activities are usually kept to a minimum to reduce the potential for market distortions or anti-competitive practices. A registry can have an arbitrary number of registrars who compete with each other on price, service and customer support.

It is not necessary, and in some case may not be desirable, for DRIP registrations to strictly follow this registrant-registrar-registry model. Prevailing circumstances and/or local policy may mean some combination of these roles could be combined. A DRIP registry might be operated by the CAA. Or it could be outsourced to a DNS registry provider. Registration policies - pricing, renewals, registrar and registrant agreements, etc. - will need to be developed. These considerations SHOULD be determined by the CAA, perhaps in consultation with local stakeholders. They are are out of scope for this document.

> Review(MGLT) / TODO(Jim): I think that the model is flexible enough so the paragraph above is not necessary. However, I think it is nice to mention that that we have the IAB the owns the ip6.arpa and so the "3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa", that it is foreseen that each CAA / RA become register to that zone (registrant) to later operate as (registry/registrar) to further HDA which in turn become (registry/registrar) for UAS owners. I put in () registrar/registry. We need to smooth the wording to not raise debates on registrar/registries.

# Terminology {#terminology}

## Required Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Additional Definitions

This document makes use of the terms (PII, USS, etc.) defined in {{RFC9153}}. Other terms (DIME, Endorsement, etc.) are from {{RFC9434}}, while others (RAA, HDA, etc.) are from {{RFC9374}}.

# DET Hierarchy in DNS

{{RFC9374}} defines the Hierarchical Host Identity Tag (HHIT) and further specifies an instance of them used for UAS RID called DETs. The HHIT is a 128-bit value that is as an IPv6 address intended primarily as an identifier rather than locator. It's format is in {{hhit-fig}} and further information is in {{RFC9374}}.

{:fig #hhit-fig title="DRIP Entity Tag Breakdown"}

The IPv6 Prefix, assigned by IANA for DETs as `2001:30::/28`, acts as the administrative and domain apex (nibble reversed as `3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa`). The scope of this document is limited to the use of DETs in DNS for UAS RID. However, other sectors may adopt this technology. It is RECOMMENDED that an global Apex (i.e. IPv6 prefix) and international Apex manager be designated for each sector. The selected domain apex (`ip6.arpa`) is under administrative control of the IAB. Thus all RAA delegations SHOULD be approved by the IAB (or their proxy). See {{iana-raa}} for more details.

Due to the nature of the hierarchy split and its relationship to nibble reversing of the IPv6 address, the upper level of hierarchy (i.e. RAAs) "borrows" the upper two bits of their respective HDA space for DNS delegation. As such the IPv6 prefix of RAAs are `2001:3x:xxx::/44` and HDAs are `2001:3x:xxxx:xx::/56` with respective nibble reverse domains of `x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa` and `y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa`.

Preallocations have been made based on the ISO 3166-1 Numeric Nation Code {{ISO3166-1}}. This is to support the initial use case of DETs in UAS RID on an international level. See {{iana-raa}} for the RAA allocations.

The RAA value of 0 is reserved for the Apex and SHOULD be used to endorse delegations of additional RAAs by the Apex. The HDA values of 0, 4096, 8192 and 12288 are reserved for operational use of an RAA, specifically when to register with the Apex and endorse delegations of HDAs in their namespace.

The administration, management and policy for operation a DIME at any level in the hierarchy (Apex, RAA or HDA), be it external or from a parent level, is out of scope for this document. In some cases, such as the RAAs and HDAs of a nation, these are National Matters which are to be dealt with by those parties accordingly.

# Public Information Registry {#dns}

Per {{RFC9434}} all information classified as public is stored in the DNS, specifically Authoritative Name Servers, to satisfy REG-1 from {{RFC9153}}.

Authoritative Name Servers use domain names as handles and data is stored in Resource Records (RR) with associated RRTypes. This document defines two new RRTypes, one for HHIT metadata (HHIT, {{hhit-rr}}) and another for UAS Broadcast RID information (BRID, {{bcast-rr}}). The former RRType is particularly important as it contains a list URIs (as part of the the certificate) that point to Private Information resources.

DETs, being IPv6 addresses, MUST be under `ip6.arpa` (nibble reversed per convention) with at minimum an HHIT RRType. Depending on local circumstances other RRTypes MAY be present. For UAS RID the BRID RRType MUST be present to provide the Broadcast Endorsements defined in {{RFC9575}}.

DNSSEC is strongly RECOMMENDED (especially for RAA-level and higher zones). When a DIME decides to use DNSSEC they SHOULD define a framework for cryptographic algorithms and key management {{RFC6841}}. This may be influenced by frequency of updates, size of the zone, and policies.

UAS specific information, such as physical characteristics, MAY also be stored in DNS but is out of scope for this document. This specification information is currently drafted in {{uas-sn-dns}}.

An example, from Apex to client, of the DNS zones in available in {{zone-examples}}.

Lookups of the above RRTypes are performed with the standard DNS methodology using the nibble reversed DET as the query name affixed to the `ip6.arpa` domain apex and asking for the specific RRType. The HHIT RRType provides the public key for signature verification and URIs via the certificate. The BRID RRType provides static Broadcast RID information such as the Broadcast Endorsements sent following {{RFC9575}}.

> TODO(Jim): is there a specific RFC that can be cited for the above paragraphs first sentence?

# Canonical Public Registration Certificate {#canonical-cert}

The following is a canonical public registration certificate, generated upon successful registration and placed into {{hhit-rr}}. It is defined here as X.509 and MAY be encoded as a C.509. Other X.509 or C.509 MAY exist for specific use cases and MUST placed in CERT RRTypes.

{: title="Example Minimal UA Registration Certificate"}

The URI extension is used to contain pointers to additional information on an HHIT. An HDA MUST included one containing the base URI for HHIT lookups in its certificate. An HDA MAY put one with the fully qualified URI for the given HHIT in their leaf certificates (as seen in the example above). These URI SHOULD use the path segment of Section 3.1.3 (`domain/<domain name>`) of {{RFC9082}}. The base URL is out of scope for this document.

The information available following the URIs MUST be protected with a AAA mechanism, per REG-2 of {{RFC9153}}. The definition of the AAA mechanism is out of scope for this document.

Additional URIs MAY be present for other use cases.

# IANA Considerations

## IANA DRIP Registry

### DRIP RAA Allocations {#iana-raa}

This document requests a new registry for RAA Allocations under the [DRIP registry group](https://www.iana.org/assignments/drip/drip.xhtml) to be managed by IANA.

RAA Allocations:

: a 14-bit value used to represent RAAs. Future additions to this registry are to be made through Expert Review (Section 4.5 of {{RFC8126}}). The following values/ranges are defined:

| RAA Value(s)  | Status    | Allocation                 | Reference                       |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0             | Allocated | UAS RID (DRIP) Apex        | This RFC                        |
| 1 - 4000      | Allocated | ISO 3166-1 Countries       | This RFC                        |
| 4001 - 16375  | Reserved  | N/A                        | N/A                             |
| 16375 - 16384 | Allocated | DRIP WG (Experimental Use) | This RFC                        |

To support DNS delegation in `ip6.arpa` a single RAA is given 4 delegations by borrowing the upper two bits of HDA space. This enables a clean nibble boundary in DNS to delegate from (i.e. the prefix `2001:3x:xxx0::/44`). These HDAs (0, 4096, 8192 and 12288) are reserved for the RAA.

The mapping between ISO 3166-1 Numeric Numbers and RAAs can be found as a CSV file on [GitHub](https://github.com/ietf-wg-drip/draft-ietf-drip-registries/blob/main/iso3166-raa.csv). Each Nation is assigned four RAAs that are left to the national authority for their purpose. For RAAs under this range a shorter prefix of `2001:3x:xx00::/40` MAY be delegated to each CAA, which covers all 4 RAAs (and reserved HDAs) assigned to them.

Since the prefix is under a zone controlled by the IAB (`ip6.arpa`) they have authority on delegation in this space. IANA and IAB SHOULD create a registration policy for RAAs that is published to allow for organization to register for an RAA value. The content and process of this registration for an RAA is out of scope for this document and left to the administrative organizations (IAB and IANA) to decide. IANA has agreed to serve as an interim Apex manager.

### HHIT Entity Type {#iana-hhit-type}

This document requests a new registry for HHIT Entity Type under the [DRIP registry group](https://www.iana.org/assignments/drip/drip.xhtml).

HHIT Entity Type:

: numeric, 16-bit, field of the HHIT RRType to encode the HHIT Entity Type. Future additions to this registry are to be made through Expert Review (Section 4.5 of {{RFC8126}}). The following values are defined:

| Value         | Type                                       | Reference    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |

# Security Considerations

## DNS Operational Considerations

The Registrar and Registry are commonly used concepts in the DNS. These components interface the DIME into the DNS hierarchy and thus operation SHOULD follow best common practices, specifically in security (such as running DNSSEC) as appropriate. The following RFC provide suitable guidance: {{RFC7720}}, {{RFC4033}}, {{RFC4034}}, {{RFC4035}}, {{RFC5155}}, {{RFC8945}}, {{RFC2182}}, {{RFC4786}}, {{RFC3007}}.

If DNSSEC is used, a DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS) SHOULD be developed and published. It SHOULD explain how DNSSEC has been deployed and what security measures are in place. {{RFC6841}} documents a Framework for DNSSEC Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements.

The interfaces and protocol specifications for registry-registrar interactions are intentionally not specified in this document. These will depend on nationally defined policy and prevailing local circumstances. It is expected registry-registrar activity will use the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) {{RFC5730}}. The registry SHOULD provide a lookup service such as WHOIS {{RFC3912}} or RDAP {{RFC9082}} to provide public information about registered domain names.

Decisions about DNS or registry best practices and other operational matters SHOULD be made by the CAA, ideally in consultation with local stakeholders.

# Public Key Exposure

DETs are built upon asymmetric keypairs. As such the public key must be revealed to enable clients to perform signature verifications.

While unlikely the forging of a corresponding private key is possible if given enough time (and computational power). As such it is RECOMMENDED that the public key for any DET not be exposed in DNS (under any RRType) until it is required.

Optimally this requires the UAS somehow signal the DIME that a flight using a Specific Session ID will soon be underway or complete. It may also be facilitated under UTM if the USS (which may or may not be a DIME) signals when a given operation using a Session ID goes active.

HHIT Entity Type:

: This field is two octets with values defined in {{iana-hhit-type}}. It is envisioned that there may be many types of HHITs in use. In some cases it may be helpful to understand the HHITs role in the ecosystem like described in {{drip-dki}}. This field provides such context.

HID Abbreviation:

: This field is meant to provide an abbreviation to the HID structure for display devices. The specific contents of this field are not defined here.

Canonical Registration Certificate:

: This field is the canonical registration certificate for the HHIT in either X.509 DER or C.509 form. It MUST contain at least the bare minimum as defined in {{canonical-cert}}.

# UAS Broadcast RID Resource Record {#bcast-rr}

This appendix is normative.

The UAS Broadcast RID Resource Record type (BRID) is a format to hold public information typically sent of the UAS Broadcast RID that is static. It can act as a data source if information is not received over Broadcast RID or for cross validation.

## Wire Format {#bcast-rr-wire}

The wire format for the BRID RRType MUST be encoded in CBOR. The CDDL of the RRType is provided in {{bcast-wire-cddl}}.

{::include cddl/bcast-rr.cddl}
~~~~
{: #bcast-wire-cddl title="BRID Wire Format CDDL"}

## Presentation Format {#bcast-rr-presentation}

The presentation format of the BRID RRType MUST be in Extended Diagnostic Notation as defined in Appendix G of {{RFC8610}}. {{hhit-text}} provides an example of a BRID RRType in this form. All byte strings longer than 20 SHOULD be displayed as base64 when possible.

The field names and their general typing are borrowed from the ASTM {{F3411}} data dictionary. See that document for additional information on fields semantics and units.

# DET DNS Zone Examples {#zone-examples}

This appendix is informative, showing an example of the DNS zone setup/content from Apex to a client.

For this example the following DETs are shown:

- Apex = `2001:0030:0000:0005:fad8:7fea:e0f6:90ad`
- RAA = `2001:003f:fe00:0005:618a:cd8e:76d3:b790`
- HDA = `2001:003f:fe00:0105:ad79:a278:1c10:5443`
- Client = `2001:003f:fe00:0105:6a26:21d4:ef57:2ef5`
  
The RAA allocation of `16376` and an HDA of `1` have been selected.
