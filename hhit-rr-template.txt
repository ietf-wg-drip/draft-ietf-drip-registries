D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

This RRTYPE is to be used for any Hierarchial Host Identity Tag (HHIT)
as defined in RFC9374 as part of its registation into the hierarchy.
HHITs SHOULD be registered to an authority entity, thus being associated
with an endorsement or certificate (held in this RRTYPE) of that
registration.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.

The RRTYPE is encoded in CBOR. The CDDL for the CBOR is as follows:

hhit-rr = [
    hhit-entity-type: uint,
    hid-abbreviation: tstr .size(15),
    canonical-registration-cert: bstr
]

In text, the RDATA is represented using a base64 string.
The length field is not represented as it is implicitly known.

F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
    and why are they unsatisfactory?

The HIP RRTYPE (55). The HIP RRTYPE does not contain a method to
provide proof/trust into the registration of an HHIT that is found in
the certificate of the proposed RRTYPE.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

HHIT

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
    or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
    Parameters?

No.

I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
    servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
    as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

No.

J. Comments:

None.
